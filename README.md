This program defines two queue implementations in C++: one using a fixed-size array (ArrayQueue) and the other using a linked list (ListQueue). Both queues support three main operations: add() to insert an element at the back, remove() to delete the front element, and showAll() to display the current queue contents. The ArrayQueue uses indices (head and tail) to track the queue's front and rear, while ListQueue uses dynamic memory and nodes linked together. The isEmpty() function in ArrayQueue checks if the queue is empty. The linked list version uses constructors for cleaner node creation and a destructor to safely deallocate memory. The main() function tests both implementations with the same values, showing how each queue handles additions and removals.
