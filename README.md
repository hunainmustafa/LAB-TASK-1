This code implements a stack in two ways: using a fixed-size array (ArrayStack) and a dynamic linked list (ListStack). Both allow adding (push) and removing (pop) elements from the top, following the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. The array version has a size limit, while the list version can grow as needed. Each class includes a print method to display the stack contents. The main function tests both implementations by pushing and popping some sample values.
