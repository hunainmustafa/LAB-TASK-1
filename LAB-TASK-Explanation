This C++ project is all about creating a console-based Airline Flight Booking System for a fictional airline named Nutkani Airlines. The goal here is to mimic the experience of booking one-way and return flights between a selection of predefined cities in Pakistan, like Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad, Skardu, Kot Addu, Gilgit, and Pindi. The system is built using object-oriented programming principles, mainly through a Flight class that keeps track of all the essential flight details, including departure and arrival cities, flight date and time, class type (Economy, Standard, Business), ticket price, and check-in time, which is automatically set to one hour before the flight departs.

Additionally, the program features a Node class and a straightforward linked list to keep a record of all booked flights. Each new booking is added to the top of the list, allowing the system to handle multiple bookings in memory while itâ€™s running. Users interact with the system via a menu-driven interface, where they can opt to book either a one-way or return flight, or view invoices for all their bookings so far. The booking process includes validating user input for city names, offering a selection of predefined departure times (05:00, 13:00, 21:00), and allowing users to choose their preferred class, which affects the final ticket price based on the route.

Ticket prices are automatically determined based on the selected city pair, and if a user opts for a return flight, the system can generate a second booking for the opposite direction. After each booking, the program provides a detailed invoice, and for return flights, it also shows a combined invoice that includes both legs of the trip along with the total cost. This project reinforces fundamental programming concepts like classes, data encapsulation, conditionals, input validation, and dynamic memory management. Overall, it serves as a practical example of how OOP can be applied in C++, illustrating how software can be structured to simulate real-world services like airline reservations.
