This C++ program demonstrates traversal techniques for both trees and graphs using Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS). It includes four main classes: TreeDFS, GraphDFS, TreeBFS, and GraphBFS. The TreeDFS class builds a binary search tree (BST) and performs a recursive preorder DFS to visit nodes. The GraphDFS class represents an undirected graph using an adjacency list and applies recursive DFS to traverse the graph from a given starting vertex. The TreeBFS class also constructs a BST but uses a queue to perform a level-order traversal (BFS). Meanwhile, GraphBFS uses an adjacency list and a queue to perform BFS on an undirected graph. In the main() function, all four traversal methods are tested with simple examples. The tree insertions maintain BST properties, while graph edges are added bidirectionally to simulate undirected graphs. DFS explores deeper paths before backtracking, while BFS explores neighbors level by level. This program helps illustrate the behavioral differences between DFS and BFS in both linear and hierarchical structures.
